<p>As a passionate of Cocktails and data, I decided to take another challenge on <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/">Kaggle</a> 
<br>This time I found a <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/shuyangli94/cocktails-hotaling-co">dataset of cocktails</a> that contains an huge list of coktails made by bars based mostly in the USA</p>
<p>The goal of this exercise and analysis was to realize a powerBI dashboard trying to improve my skills with the graphic part there, focusing more on the visual representation and the data organization of the page trying to build up a using a pop up Menu to the side.<p>
<p>The Dataset it's as well as a good one for doing some NLP applications, so it's required a really well-done pre-processing phase at the begin.
<br>You can see the final Dashboard that is public <a href="https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiMTY5ZWJlZDktODQ5Mi00Mjg4LTkzNDYtOTYyZDVmMDQ3Y2EwIiwidCI6ImVkMGUzNDE0LTZlNTYtNDU0Yy04YTgyLWViODBiZWZiNzM4YiIsImMiOjh9&pageName=ReportSectionee81158eebd0e3d61a37">here</a></p>

<h1> Cocktail Analysis – Pre-Processing Phase </h1>

<p> The most interesting thing of this dataset is that contain a lot of raw data that require a clean-up before further analysis. 
Doing pre-processing in PowerBI is something that I never did before, or at least not at the level of details like this time, cause i think that doing pre processing is much easier using like a Python script.
After a quick look at the dataset, I saw that I had a few fields that are interesting but as they are organized, they cannot be used for the next analysis step.
In fact the fields “Garnish” and “Ingredients” contains informations about the ingredients and garnishes specifing the quantities for the cocktails preparation. What i wanted to do was to isolate exactly the informations about : garnish and ingredient name and garnish and ingredient quantity.
The Pre-Processing phase in PowerBI is the following: 
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Splitting the columns "Ingredients” and "Garnish" by the comma delimiter.</li>
  <li>Splitting the columns "Ingredients" and "Garnish" previously splitted, isolating for each ingredient and garnish, the quanity of them generating a new column for each item called "quantity"</li>
</ul>

<p>In most of the cases at the second point, for the creation of the column quanity, the process was rough, i used a lot of times the function in PowerBI: "Columns from Examples" </p>
